            Her name is Nadira Dwi Larasati, she was born on January 11, 2006. She is a good child, smart, and very devoted to her parents. She is always a cheerful child, and when she`s feels sad, she always hides her sadness and admits
            that everything is fine. She is the most beautiful student at SMKN 6 Jakarta. She has two cats named Abu and Asbit. She also likes playing a game called Free Fire; she is very good at that game. She is a very beautiful and smart
            child. During elementary school, she always ranked in the top 10. I love her very much, I don't like it when she feels insecure because she is very perfect, and I am also happy if she feels happy. I hope all good things come toher.
